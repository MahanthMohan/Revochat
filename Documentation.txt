Revochat Terminal Messaging App:

Prompt --> Make an app using Python that allows you to message other users using any type of terminal (Linux, UNIX, Command Prompt, etc)
Note: Use Firebase to store User Data such as Credentials and Messages as a json file cannot show changes for multiple users

Steps:

1. Register
    --> Collect User Credentials, and store them in the Firebase Realtime Database
    --> Make sure that the username and password fields are not left empty and they are filled with some text
    --> Make sure that the username is an email, i.e contains @ and .com
    --> Store User Credentials (Name, Username, and Password) in Firebase
    --> Direct to Login

2. Login 
    --> Login to account
    --> Check whether the entered login credentials match the registered credentials, which is returned from the Firebase tag
    --> If yes, direct the user to the Send Messages screen, or else redirect to login

3. Send Messages
    --> Show all the Previous Messages (Get from the messages tag stored in Firebase)
    --> Prompt the user to send a message while True, so that the loop is undending unless the user exits
    --> Press y for reload, and n for continue sending message
    --> If not, the user can press e for exit and exit Revochat
